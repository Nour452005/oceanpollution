     <p>Every year, millions of tons of plastic and waste enter our oceans, harming marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Fish, turtles, and seabirds often mistake plastic for food, leading to severe health issues and even death.</p>
      <p>Ocean pollution not only threatens wildlife but also impacts human health and the global economy. Toxic chemicals from plastic can enter the food chain, while polluted waters affect tourism and fishing industries.</p>
      <p>üåç Protecting the ocean is vital for a sustainable future. By reducing single-use plastics, supporting clean-up efforts, and spreading awareness, we can all make a difference.</p>
